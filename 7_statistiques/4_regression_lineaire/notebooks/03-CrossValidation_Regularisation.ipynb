    ">Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern statistics. They\n",
    "involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model\n",
    "of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about\n",
    "the fitted model. For example, in order to estimate the variability of a linear\n",
    "regression fit, we can repeatedly draw different samples from the training\n",
    "data, fit a linear regression to each new sample, and then examine the\n",
    "extent to which the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to\n",
    "obtain information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using different\n",
    "subsets of the training data. However, due to recent advances in computing\n",
    "power, the computational requirements of resampling methods generally\n",
    "are not prohibitive. [...] cross-validation can be used to estimate the test\n",
    "error associated with a given statistical learning method in order to evaluate\n",
    "its performance, or to select the appropriate level of flexibility. The process\n",
    "of evaluating a model’s performance is known as model assessment, whereas model\n",

Here the train and validation sets are used to do model assesment and model selection (NOTE: the test set is strictly forbidden from being used in any way during this process!). Once a model is selected the test set is used to do a final assesment of performance to see if the model selected will generalise as well as predicted.\n",

    "An alternative to choosing models which contains smaller numbers of features is to use a method that *constrains* or *regularises* the coefficent estimates assigned to each feature, or that shrinks the coefficient towards zero. This technique is very similar to *least squares* which we have been using until now. Please refer to Section in 6.2 **ISTL** for a fuller explanation of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we move to use a regularised linear regression for prediction the additional term means that we now have a model parameter that requires setting or tuning. These terms are referred to as *hyperparameters* in machine learning. In practice this introduces another additional unknown parameter which we must choose somewhere in our modelling. It is common practice to run several models, each with different values of this hyperparameter, and then assess the error of each using cross validation for comparison.\n",

[The film Moneyball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4QPVo0UIzc) is well worth a watch if you have time.
